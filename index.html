    <p class="introduction">
        Happy Christmas Alex! Please solve these puzzles to unlock your gift :)
    </p>
    <p class="rules">
        These puzzles are similar in nature to those you'd find in Puzzled Pint. Each puzzle has a link you can use to check your answer. 
        If you're right, it will reveal some information that will help you unlock your gift! 
    </p>
    <p class="rules">
        You can freely look up things you don't know, use reverse image search (e.g. Google Lens) if it's helpful, or collaborate with anyone else.
        There are plenty of puzzle enthusiasts in the office who would be more than willing to help out!
